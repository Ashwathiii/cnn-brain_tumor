# Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning
### Description
This project aims to develop a deep learning model for the detection of brain tumors in medical images. The model utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and explores techniques such as hyperparameter tuning and transfer learning to achieve accurate tumor classification.

## Usage
- **Data Preparation**: Organize your dataset into training and testing sets. Ensure that images are properly labeled according to tumor types.

- **Model Training**: Use the provided scripts to train the model on the training data. Adjust hyperparameters and explore different optimizer options to optimize performance.

- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model on the testing dataset to assess its accuracy, precision, recall, and other performance metrics.

- **Transfer Learning**: Optionally, explore transfer learning techniques using pre-trained models such as VGG16 to enhance model performance.

- **Results Analysis**: Analyze the results and visualize model performance metrics to gain insights into the effectiveness of different techniques.

## Data

The dataset consists of medical images of brain tumors, including pituitary tumors, gliomas, meningiomas, and images without tumors. Images are in standard image formats (e.g., JPEG) and are resized to 150x150 pixels for consistency.
